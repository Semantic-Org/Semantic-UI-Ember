# Versioning

The versioning follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/.)

  {major}.{minor}.{increment}

## MAJOR
The major version will increment when there are public api-level incompatibilities released.

## MINOR
The minor version will increment when functionality is added in a backwards-compatible manner or when we rollover years.

## INCREMENT
The last number is incremented each time we deploy another version. It should always start out as 1. These must be API-compatible changes. If they break any form of the public API then the MAJOR version needs to be updated.
